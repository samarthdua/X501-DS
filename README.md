# X501-DS

This repository was used to managed in-class development work during a programming basics module taken as part of the MSIS Core. In this class, our work was focused on learning the tools to build API-driven responsive web dashboards. We gained experience with managing an AWS EC2 instance, using PHP to manage the server side, and Vue.JS to manage the client side. A MySQL Server was set up on the EC2 instance to manage the data for the dashboard.
